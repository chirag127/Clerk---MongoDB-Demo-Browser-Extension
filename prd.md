**Product Requirements Document: Clerk & MongoDB Demo Browser Extension**

**1. Introduction**

*   **Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for building a fully functional, production-ready browser extension. The primary goal of this extension is to serve as a clear, practical demonstration of integrating Clerk for user authentication and MongoDB for data persistence within the context of a Manifest V3 browser extension environment.
*   **Target AI:** This PRD is directed at an AI Code Assistant responsible for generating the complete codebase and associated artifacts.
*   **Product Goal:** To deliver a robust, well-documented, and easy-to-understand example extension that developers can use as a reference implementation. This is **not an MVP**; it must be a complete and polished demonstration.

**2. Goals & Objectives**

*   Successfully implement user authentication (Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out, Session Management) using Clerk within a Manifest V3 extension.
*   Demonstrate secure data storage and retrieval using MongoDB, accessed via a dedicated backend API, ensuring data isolation between users.
*   Provide a clean, functional, and error-free user interface within the extension's popup.
*   Deliver a complete, production-ready codebase adhering to best practices for security, maintainability, and documentation.
*   Ensure the final product functions correctly and reliably across modern browsers supporting Manifest V3 (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

**3. Target Audience (of the Extension)**

*   Developers looking for examples of integrating modern authentication (Clerk) and database solutions (MongoDB) into browser extensions.
*   Developers needing a reference for handling authentication tokens and secure API communication from a Manifest V3 extension.

**4. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1. Core Extension Structure:**
    *   Utilize Manifest V3 specifications.
    *   The primary user interaction point will be the extension's **popup**.
    *   A background service worker may be necessary for tasks like managing authentication tokens or handling specific events, but the core user flow happens in the popup.
*   **4.2. Authentication (Clerk):**
    *   **Sign Up/Sign In:** Users must be able to sign up for a new account or sign in to an existing account using Clerk's provided UI elements or APIs integrated directly within the extension's popup. The authentication flow should be handled seamlessly.
    *   **Session Management:** User sessions must persist reliably across browser restarts as managed by Clerk. The extension UI must accurately reflect the user's logged-in or logged-out state.
    *   **User Information Display:** When logged in, the popup should display basic, non-sensitive user information obtained from Clerk (e.g., email address or username).
    *   **Sign Out:** A clear "Sign Out" button must be available for logged-in users, which securely ends the Clerk session and updates the UI accordingly.
    *   **Token Handling:** Securely manage Clerk authentication tokens (JWTs). These tokens will be used to authenticate requests to the backend API.
*   **4.3. Data Persistence (MongoDB via Backend API):**
    *   **Backend API Requirement:** A simple, secure backend API (e.g., Node.js/Express or Serverless Function) **must be created** as part of this project. This API will:
        *   Connect securely to a MongoDB database.
        *   Expose CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for a simple data type (e.g., "User Notes").
        *   **Integrate with Clerk for Backend Authentication:** Validate incoming requests using Clerk JWTs passed from the browser extension.
        *   **Enforce Data Authorization:** Ensure users can only Create, Read, Update, and Delete *their own* data (e.g., notes associated with their unique Clerk User ID).
    *   **Extension-Backend Interaction:**
        *   The browser extension (specifically, the popup script) will communicate with this backend API over HTTPS.
        *   All requests to protected backend endpoints must include the user's valid Clerk authentication token.
    *   **CRUD Operations (User Notes Example):**
        *   **Create:** Logged-in users can create a simple text note via an input field and a "Save" button in the popup. The note should be saved to MongoDB via the backend API, associated with their user ID.
        *   **Read:** Logged-in users can view a list of their previously saved notes within the popup.
        *   **Update:** Logged-in users can edit the text of their existing notes.
        *   **Delete:** Logged-in users can delete their existing notes.
*   **4.4. User Interface (Popup):**
    *   Display appropriate UI based on authentication state (e.g., show Sign In/Sign Up options if logged out, show user info/notes/logout button if logged in).
    *   Provide clear visual feedback for actions (e.g., loading indicators during API calls, success/error messages).
    *   Present the list of user notes clearly.
    *   Include intuitive controls for adding, editing (optional, but preferred for completeness), and deleting notes.
    *   The UI must be functional and **completely free of console errors** during normal operation.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **5.1. Security:**
    *   All communication between the extension and the backend API must use HTTPS.
    *   Backend API endpoints must be protected and require valid Clerk authentication.
    *   Authorization must be strictly enforced at the API level (users access only their data).
    *   No sensitive credentials (API keys, Clerk secrets, DB connection strings) should be stored in the frontend/extension code. Configuration should rely on environment variables for the backend and secure handling for Clerk publishable keys in the frontend.
    *   User input should be sanitized where appropriate to prevent injection attacks.
*   **5.2. Performance:**
    *   The extension popup should load quickly.
    *   API calls should be reasonably performant. Use appropriate loading states in the UI.
*   **5.3. Reliability:**
    *   Graceful error handling must be implemented for API communication failures, authentication issues, and unexpected backend errors. Informative messages should be shown to the user.
*   **5.4. Maintainability & Code Quality:**
    *   Code must be well-organized, following the specified project structure.
    *   Code must be thoroughly documented with comments explaining complex logic, function purposes, and setup requirements.
    *   Adhere to standard best practices for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the chosen backend language (e.g., Node.js). Use clear variable names and consistent coding style.
    *   No "TODO" comments or placeholder logic should remain in the final deliverable.
*   **5.5. Usability:**
    *   The extension interface should be simple and intuitive for the target developer audience.

**6. Technical Specifications**

*   **6.1. Frontend (Browser Extension):**
    *   **Platform:** Browser Extension
    *   **Manifest Version:** Manifest V3
    *   **Languages/Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   **Authentication Library:** Clerk Frontend JavaScript SDK (@clerk/clerk-js or equivalent for browser extensions if available/necessary).
*   **6.2. Backend (API Layer):**
    *   **Requirement:** Must be created by the AI agent.
    *   **Recommendation:** Node.js with Express.js (Alternatives like Serverless Functions using Node.js are acceptable if functionally equivalent and secure).
    *   **Authentication:** Clerk Backend SDK (e.g., `@clerk/clerk-sdk-node`) for token verification and middleware.
    *   **Database:** MongoDB.
    *   **Database Driver:** Official MongoDB Node.js Driver (or Mongoose ODM).
*   **6.3. Database:**

*   The backend API runs correctly when following the setup instructions in the README.
*   The solution is **complete and production-ready** in the context of a demonstration application (no placeholders, unfinished features, or obvious security flaws).

**10. Quality Assurance & Testing**

*   The AI agent is responsible for ensuring the delivered code functions as described.
*   Perform functional testing covering all user flows: Sign Up, Sign In, Add Note, View Notes, Delete Note, Sign Out, error conditions (e.g., trying to access data when logged out).
*   Verify that security best practices mentioned (HTTPS, token auth, backend validation, authorization) are implemented.
*   Ensure the code is linted or follows consistent style guidelines.
*   **Crucially, confirm the absence of JavaScript errors in the browser's developer console during the execution of primary user flows within the extension popup.**
